please also display the amount of students inside each group when pressing the button. and please count how many items are inside off student_n

thank you. i want to make a basic three.js scene. for every time i press one of the buttons,

it should create a x stacks of n planes with texture.
x  = the amount of students in a group. (studentCount)
n = the amount of items in students (itemCount)
texture  = content[i]

it should load in with a grid of planes. the rows will be decided by "studentCount". the depht will be decided by "contentCount". the planes should load a texture "content"

thank you. i want to make a basic three.js scene. for every time i press one of the buttons,

it should create a i stacks of j planes with texture.
i  = the amount of students in a group. (studentCount)j
n = the amount of items in students (itemCount)
texture  = content[i]

example:
"group_4": {
                "student_1": [
                    "content/group_4/student_1/week_1/processed/b4_ref.png",
                    "content/group_4/student_1/week_1/processed/x.png"
                ],
                "student_2": [
                    "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b3_ref.png",
                    "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b4_ref.png",
                     "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b2_ref.png"
                ]
            }

when i press button "group_4", it should display 2 stacks of planes. (beacuse there are 2 student items in group_4). 
in stack 1, there should be 2  ( lenght of content of student_1) planes. the planes should have textures: "content/group_4/student_1/week_1/processed/b4_ref.png" and "content/group_4/student_1/week_1/processed/x.png".  (these textures are the content of student _1) 

in stack 2, there should be 3 planes (lenght of content of student_2). the planes should have textures: "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b3_ref.png" , "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b4_ref.png" and "content/group_4/student_2/week_1/processed/b2_ref.png". (these textures are the content of student _2)
