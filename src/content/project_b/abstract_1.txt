"a-Shopping Plague: A Phantasmagorical Tracing of the Leftovers" explores the architectural potential of leftovers, challenging traditional boundaries and reimagining design's role. Embracing fragmentation and rejecting established hierarchies, the research employs collages and overlaps to redefine the design process based on coincidences and intuitive creation.

The study recognizes the inherent qualities of places, fragments, and objects in shaping architectural narratives. Assuming the role of a collector, the architect comprehends, collects, and juxtaposes these elements, weaving a tapestry of meaning. The political structures of the city and the complexity of subjects are integral to the design process, celebrating existence's profound beauty and challenging objectivist perspectives.

Using a hermeneutic approach, the research embraces randomness and complexity, rejecting positivism. The dialogue between subject and interpreted object becomes paramount, influenced by contextual and personal considerations. This interactive process generates a "third space" where mutual interactions breed new realities, understanding, and participation.

The case study unfolds in Genk, where chance encounters and exploration of forgotten spaces inspire architectural investigation. From the Turkish bakery of C-mine to the enigmatic district of New Sledderlo, with its mosque as a sanctuary amidst desolation, Genk reveals the interconnectedness of seemingly unrelated encounters.

Within the urban landscape, structures like Shopping 1 and Shopping 2 challenge conventional proportions and serve as fertile ground for exploration. Shopping 2, in particular, holds hidden stories within its forgotten halls. A table of free books symbolizes solace and knowledge, and the internet becomes a valuable resource for unraveling Shopping 2's destiny, revealing the intertwined fate of architecture and the mosque.

The culmination of the research involves an encounter with Guido Walgrave, the architect responsible for both the mosque and Shopping 2. Despite language barriers, he reveals Shopping 2's visionâ€”a passage interweaving neighboring gardens, awaiting the revelation of a hidden structure. Cartesian space emerges as a guiding principle, harmonizing scale models, archival records, renders, and hand drawings.

"A-Shopping Plague: A Phantasmagorical Tracing of the Leftovers" invites fellow seekers of innovative perspectives to celebrate the emancipation of leftovers, the negotiation of fragments, and the triumph of architectural exploration. By challenging norms and embracing the freedom of creative processes, this research aims to ignite fresh perspectives and cultivate transformative possibilities within the realm of architecture.
